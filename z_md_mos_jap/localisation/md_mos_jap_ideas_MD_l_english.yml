 DYNAMIC_MODIFIER_idea_mdmosjap_JAP_depopulation_desc:0 "It was too late. No one would be able to stop the depopulation of Japan, never ever. Truly, the past Japanese government once had an objective to reduce the population when the 1973 Oil Crisis had happened, but political scientists and activists are pointing out that the most critical cause is the lacking of social policies on child care and the unimproved male-dominant authoritarian society, that was overlooked since the High Economic Growth Era. The subsequential Heisei economic crisis was the last blow to crush the hope of the third baby boom. In 2000 Japan had 126.8 million people but many think-tanks estimate that Japan will be depopulated into 46 million - 64 million in the Year 2100. Every political party concerns this and proposes the solution of depopulation such as rollbacking the society to the paternal society or welcoming the immigrants, but every analyst convinces that the population of Japan will never grow again until 2070s, even if the nation picked the best policy.\n\n§RThe depopulation will be accelerated by 1% every year.§!\n§RThe Health Cost and Social Spending Cost will be increased by 0.5% every year.§!"
