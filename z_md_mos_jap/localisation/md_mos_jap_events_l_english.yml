But two nightmares - 1995's Great Hanshin Awaji Earthquake and 1997's Asian Financial Crisis - made a mess of our efforts.\n\nNevertheless the demand from the market was never running out by the technological innovation of global telecommunication. Also, some urgent law renovations by former regimes' succeeded to re-create new factories and workspaces. Japan's decade economy of \"ice age\" will be warmed again."

 mdmosjap_japan.introduce1.d:0 "In 1992, Shin Kanemaru, the leader of the largest partisan \"Keiseikai\" (renamed to Heiseiken) in LDP and also roled as the kingfish of Japanese politics, was arrested for corruption. First, Kanemaru got a 500 million yens of contribution from the delivery company Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin but he did not report this. The company, which was already amalgamated into the parent company for the case describes below, was run by Hiroyasu Watanabe, who had a connection with a Yakuza group Inagawakai and gained a strong connection with Kanemaru for the past intermediation to stop the \"backhanded compliment\" attack by the right-wing group Nihon Kominto against Kanemaru's confidant Noboru Takeshita, who had run for the LDP presidential election campaign. Second, Kanemaru had succeeded a bank debenture bond as an asset from his ceased wife, but he did not report this to the tax authorities. The investigation against him and his secretary revealed more than a billion yen not paid yet and another 10 million yens of gold bars hidden in his safe. In the end, Kanemaru was arrested for the latter case but the people were already disappointed for not being arrested in the former case.\nHis scandal caused a nationwide distrust against the politics, then the LDP was lost in the 1993 Lower House General Election. The LDP's long hegemony since 1955 ended once. After taking back the ruler's seat by the accusation for the non-LDP Hosokawa administration with the pretext of his involvement in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal, the LDP attacked the Komei-to, the party backed by the Nichiren-school-Buddhism-based excommunicated religion group Soka Gakkai, to grope with a coalition with the Japan Socialist Party (JSP), and the other anti-LDP conservatives and anti-communists formed a new party, Shinshin-to (New Frontier Party). The Shinshin-to, led by Ichiro Ozawa who was a former Keiseikai faction LDP member, built the largest opposition party, but they also were backed by Soka Gakkai too. For this reason and the pledge discordance on the taxation policy, the vote was split and the Shinshin-to had failed to get the ruling seat in the 1996 Lower House General Election.\nWhile the Shinshin-to was going to collapse and the Komei-to was going to an independent path, the JSP has also collapsed. The JSP's coalition with conservative LDP let their supporters' eyes to see it as the \"conversion of ideology\", which caused the split of the party between left and right of socialism. The coalition was collapsed, then the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) were born. The sole fortunate overthrower LDP had changed their mind for stabilising their reign, then approached the Komei-to, and the Jiyu-to (Liberal Party, LP), one of the results of the Shinshin-to's collapse and led by Ozawa. They agreed on a coalition with LDP.\nIn the election of 1999, the LDP-Komei-LP \"Ji-Ji-Ko\" coalition won the election and retook the ruler's seat with the confidence of the election."

 mdmosjap_japan.170425001.d:0 "9:18 AM, April 25, 2005 - An Fukuchiyama Line (JR Takaradzuka Line) intercity rapid-service train, operated by JR West, has been derailed at the curve and collided with the 1st parking floor of an Apartment in Amagasaki City, Hyogo. In the first report, many people believed that 6 cars of a multiple-unit train derailed, but the rescue team revealed that the train had 7 cars but the controlling car which had been placed at the forward had been completely buried in the apartment. According to the investigation, the train had entered the sharp right curve at 72 mph even though the curve has limited the running speed to the section up to 43 mph. It shows that the centrifugal force made the train derail and crash into the apartment.\nAccording to the interrogation from the conductor who was on the last car, he and the killed motorman had attempted to recover the 90 seconds delay because the company is inflicting harsh punishments on every motorman and the conductor who had failed in the train operation. For example, being forced to hand-copy the whole working rules of the company, being forced to stand on an asphalt-paved platform on the summer sunny day, being forced to be bombarded by other operators with abusive languages - that is what the company imposed to train operators who caused the mere tens seconds of delay or the over-run mere one meter. That punishment, the \"daily service-serving education (Nikkin Kyoiku)\", has used to be introduced to suppress the power of labourer unions when the Japan National Railway (JNR) was being privatised and being transformed into the six Japan Railway (JR) companies in the Nakasone administration.\nFortunately, another limited express train, which was coming from the opposite track that had been blocked by derailed cars, has urgently stopped before it had hit. However, it was morning commuter time and many passengers were taken, so 107 were killed and 562 were injured by the accident. This is the worst tragedy in Japanese railroad history. Some medical specialists pointed out that many passengers did not die shortly after the collision but had from the crush syndrome."

 mdmosjap_japan.740510001.d:0 "On June 16th of 2005, an ex-Imperial Japanese Army soldier passed away.\n\nKenzo Okuzaki, born in 1920, was in service on the Papua New Guinea front after being transferred from China and was a man who was disloyal to his officer. On the first day of his troop's landing in New Guinea, the USAF bombed them and he started the escape from New Guinea. Surviving from the fear of starvation and glimpsing other Japanese soldiers' bodies rotten or bulged by the gas, he lost his right little finger to the native's attack, then finally surrendered to the American troops. Okuzaki was treated by an American doctor, not like being killed as he once believed, and then detained in Australia until the war ended.\n\nAs he stabbed a captain of demobilisation ship for the captain's misappropriation of food for the demobilised, and accidentally murdered an estate agent by the trouble in the leasing agreement, his disloyalty and anti-authority were totally transformed into the vengeance against injustices - especially Emperor Hirohito as the ultimate symbol of injustice. But he changed his mind in the end: the assassination of Hirohito is not only worthless for solving the social structure of post-war Japan which still kept the Emperor system, but also may just rebuild another different type of Emperor-like system by the society instead of discontinuing the Emperor system. Then he changed his plan to shoot Hirohito, not with a gun but with a slingshot, to gather the mass media's attention.\n\nAfter being released from the ten-year prison term, on January 2nd of 1969, Okuzaki attended the new-year ceremony in the Imperial Palace that was paused for six years for the construction of the new Chowa-den building, then screamed \"Yamazaki, shoot the Emperor with your pistol!\" - \"Yamazaki\" was the name of his colleague soldier who possibly died in New Guinea. Okuzaki gathered other participants' eyes then shot four slingshots toward Hirohito. His shot did not hit Hirohito eventually, but during the 22 months of custody without the judgement, Okuzaki wrote his thoughts aforementioned into 36 notebooks and 193 pages of written statements. In the statement, he blamed mankind for the forming of the Emperor system or the Emperor-like system in their own structure of human society and condemned Buddha, Jesus, Confucius, Carl Marx, and Mao Zedong as useless. He published that statement as a book: \"Yamazaki, Shoot the Emperor!\".\n\nAfter being released again, Okuzaki has arrested again for distributing pornographies that photofablicated with faces of the Imperial Family, ran as a candidate for the Upper House in the jail, then being released again and he published a book titled with the death threat against Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. While recording the WWII documentary film \"The Emperor's Naked Army Marches On\" (1987), in which Okuzaki played himself, he was arrested for the attempted murder of a son of an ex-company commander whom Okuzaki targeted, and released in 1997. While there are considerable dangerous criminal records, surprisingly Okuzaki is neither famous nor infamous for his acts. However, his reputation by someone who knows about him is various: a tragic veteran, a victim of the age, a paranoid psycho, a vicious criminal, an anti-Imperial-system anarchist, a fighter against the authorities, a man who has been forced to be forgotten by the post-war-style unwritten lese-majesty, or just an actor, or just a writer."

The fire breaks out at the previously mentioned Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, but the extinguish was delayed two hours due to the mistake of communication sharing on the early-stage fire fighting, which caused radioactive leakage though it was within the environmentally ignorable level. This earthquake has occurred only 4 months later from the Noto Earthquake and 3 years later from the destructive 2004 Niigata Chuetsu Earthquake."

The relay was to held in Nagano City, the place of the 1998 Winter Olympics Games, but Zenkoji Temple refused to be the starting line of the torch relay for the sympathy to the Tibetan Buddhists. April 26th, beyond the estimate of the police, the starting line became a literal chaotic place by four thousand Chinese students as well as a large number of foreign and Japanese activists and journalists surpassing the ideology of left and right. Some Japanese activists were blaming the government and security authorities for the prohibition of entry in several places where had been reserved for the runner's resting or ceremony.\n\nA torrent of raised flags. Five-Starred Red flag. Olympics flag. Tibetan flag. East Turkestan flag. Inner Mongolia flag. Blue Sky with A White Sun flag. Taiwan independentist flag. South Vietnam flag. Another Olympics flag but five handcuffs instead of five circles. Japanese flag, as well as Rising Sun flag. Conflicts for these flags among Chinese students and Japanese or foreign activists. A torch relay runner running in surrounded by ninety escorting police officers. A Tibetan refugee disturbing a runner and shouting \"Free Tibet\". A Japanese man throwing a raw egg at a runner...\n\nAfter the chaos, a Tibetan refugee and five Japanese have arrested. Meanwhile, at Zenkoji Temple, activists and journalists performed the protest against the oppression in Tibet by the Chinese government and chanted a sutra of mourning for the Tibetan victims. These disturbances have completely exceeded the people, government, and local or central security authorities estimated.

 mdmosjap_japan.220720001.d:0 "Kim Hyun Hui is a former North Korean terrorist who committed the 1987 terrorist bombing of Korean Air Flight 858. She was born in North Korea, then she was grown as a multilingual espionage agent. After the terror attack, she testified to South Korean investigators that she had been taught the Japanese language and Japanese culture by a woman tutor, Lee Un Hye. She drew the portrait of Lee, but it was very similar to a missing Japanese woman, Yaeko Taguchi. So the Japanese government agent showed the photograph of Taguchi, the Kim confirmed that Lee is Taguchi and she is alive.\n\nAfter being granted a pardon by the South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, she lives somewhere in South Korea. And now, she is strongly wishing to visit Japan to meet with the parents of Taguchi. It may become a huge milestone for accusing North Korea's abductions, but Japan's Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act is preventing the entry of foreigners who once was sentenced to the death penalty, so she cannot visit even it was nullified by the South Korean government. The Minister of Justice can admit her entrance as an extra-legal measure, but it will presumably cause a large backlash by right-wing nationalists."

 mdmosjap_japan.220830001.d:0 "Another pension blunder has been found out. July 29th, 111 years old man was found dead with a partially becoming skeleton. He was born in 1899 and the municipality where he had lived believed he was alive until the day, but the autopsy has confirmed that he had been already dead in 1978, the 32 years ago. The local police have arrested his bereaved family for the fraud of pension receiving. As the news spreads, all municipalities had started confirming the pensioner's existence, and as a result, it has revealed that many old ages who were being believed living more than a hundred years have died at least six years ago. In the investigation, some pensioners recorded as over 150 years old, which means they are born in 1860 if they were alive. In Iki City, Nagasaki Prefecture, an old man already confirmed to be dead quite a long time ago has recorded 200 years old and living. If he were still alive, he would be listed on the Guinness World Records as a world longest alive person from 1810, the same year Frederic Chopin was born. These sensational cases are concluded as the lack of investigation by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the municipalities, and the authorities of pension. The minister of MHLW have apologised for these stories and stated that the every pensioners who are not identified by the municipalities will be omitted from the pension program. Although the police and the prosecutors have arrested many bereaved families for these cases and are going to file charge them for the fraud as well as the abandoning of the dead body, the authorities also told that they cannot make them to return the pensions already taken more than five years ago for the statute of limitations in the fraud crime."

Hirata was put on the wanted list for helping to escape other Aum criminals by car then escaping himself too. Today, he showed himself suddenly at a police station in Tokyo and surrendered. He talked a story to the police investigator: he was married to Naoko Kikuchi, another female terrorist, and used to live as an average civilian in his escaping time, but he started regretting his runaway-life by watching the aftermath of the 3.11 disaster and the survivors' effort to the reconstruction. He added that he once attempted to surrender himself at another police station on the same day, but the police officer assured he is not similar to the picture on the special wanted criminals' lists and set him free for a while. After arresting him, the national police have started again the massive campaign to gather the information of the rest Aum terrorists. On the other hand, survivors and bereaved families of the series of Aum terrorism such as the sarin attacks are criticising the police's initial mismanagement on the verification in the his surrendering as well as \"why was the police losing every sight of them in these seventeen years\"."

Among leftists to rightists, many people are getting anxious that the article may connect to the negation of individual human rights and the regression of women's rights. But, the most controversial stuff is the latter one: when the Japanese State is suffering the highest-level urgent situation, such as a foreign attack, domestic terrorism like Aum Shinrikyo's subway attack, or a disaster like last year's Disaster, the government can execute \"the State Emergency Prerogative (Kinkyu Jitai Joukou)\" to restrict every citizen's rights as long as it does not violate human rights, and also can close the Diet temporarily.\n\nNeedless to say the leftists are, but some LDP-voters and centre-rightists are also complaining about this new draft is too radical. Almost all people are showing a dislike to \"the State Emergency Prerogative\" for the afraid of restriction of human rights and the fading of Japan's democracy. On the other hand, right-wing nationalists, populists, and fanatic LDP supporters are welcoming the draft as \"the best of the best to defend our national interests\".

However, the fabricated subtitles written in Japanese and Hungarian languages told that the Diet session is the memorial service for the mourning of the Treaty of Trianon, the Prime Minister is showing an expression by paying tributes to Hungarian fighters for the Hungarian irredentism, then the Opposition's Dietperson is strongly approving the Prime Minister's remarks with the metaphor of David and Goliath.\n\nJapanese people are spreading this video as some kind of meme for its ridiculously fabricated situation, its fabricated conversation, and its fabricated but grammatically correct but unfamiliar translation."

At 8:20 AM of July 3rd, the people in Izusan, a villa town locates northeast valley of the neighbour of central Atami, the far east end of Shizuoka Prefecture, reported a massive discharge of water and mud from the mountain. After two hours later, at 10:28 AM, a local resident called the fire department that the landslide was destroying a house. And as rescue teams arrived, a catastrophic volume of mud landslide flushed through the valley then tens of houses and cars were destroyed and buried. The landslides had attacked the valley again and again, the mud went down through the underpass of Tokaido Shinkansen and Tokaido Main Line, reached the coast side of the town. The scene was recorded by many residents and has been uploaded to the Internet. The landslide destroys 131 houses, killed 19 people, injured 3, and 8 residents are still missing.\nAs the news spreads on the Internet, SNS users used to be glaring their suspicious eyes toward the \"Mega Solar\", the solar power station installed on the higher ridge of Izusan, as the decisive \"suspect\" of the landslide. On the other hand, according to the disaster report by the Shizuoka Prefecture, the landslide had come from the other side of the solar power station. The research has revealed that the origin of the landslide was fifty thousands cubic kilometers of tons of soil that had been illegally poured and buried atop the valley."

 mdmosjap_japan.340201001.t:0 "Shintaro Ishihara Passed Away"
 mdmosjap_japan.340201001.d:0 "Today, the famous writer and the retired politician Shintaro Ishihara has passed away.\n\nShintaro Ishihara came out with his first book, \"Gray Classroom\". He won the Bungei Shunju's Newcomer Award for his second novel, \"Season of the Sun (Season of Violence, 1955)\". Like \"Crazed Fruit\" and \"Execution Room\" (both 1956), his novels have been filled with the summer energy of youth and sexual immorality so sometimes he got an opinion by critics as an anti-social before. As his novel cinematised with his young brother and actor Yujiro Ishihara, his books created the new generation, \"Taiyo-zoku\", which had military hair (called Sports Cuts), wore sunglasses and Hawaiian shirts, and indulged in the sex with someone. This Taiyo-zoku movement finally caused the age restriction and the rating organisation for the movie.\n\nHe also wrote a lot of essays as a social critic, and got a lot of applause and criticism in his life. \"Spartan Education\" (1969) created the national generation movement of parental education: to be harsh and to be violent against their children like once Greek Spartans did. \"The Japan That Cannot Say No (The Japan That Can Say No: Why Japan Will Be First Among Equals, 1989)\", co-written with Akio Morita, the Chairman of Sony, praised the Japanese ability for technologies, criticised business cultures in the United States, and also criticised Japanese weakness on business and self-assertion.\n\nWhile having made in debut on the political stage as a Dietmember, he got strong criticism for his theory of education, nationalistic ideology, and a lot of gaffes, sometimes with racism and ableism. He visited the Yasukuni Shrine every year, he always called China as \"Shina\", and he denied the crime of forced labour against the comforted women by the Imperial Japanese Army during WWII. In his term as the Chief of the Environment Agency, although he apologised to the sufferers of Minamata disease as the government, he called some Minamata survivors, \"they have low IQ\" and \"they do nothing but just want subsidies\" in 1976. In the 3.11 disaster, he left a gaffe: \"We need to wash the (Japanese) greediness by this tsunami at this time. So this is Heaven's judgement\". Meanwhile, during his term as Tokyo Metropolitan Governor, he enacted the emission control in advance of the world's movement, and he continued to apologise to the Korean victims of racist demagogues in the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake.\n\nAlbeit his ideology and principles, he is still getting a firm reputation by leftist critics too as well as the rightists. However, the public reputation for him is now purely divided - in a sense, he had freedom in his thinking; in a sense, he did not have prudence in his saying."

Abe was immediately transported to the hospital but died at 5:03 PM.\n\nThe moment of the assassination was being recorded by the public that was to listen to Abe's speech. The attacker, ex-JMSDF personnel, testified that he made guns by himself instead of hand-made bombs and shot two. He is referring to a certain religious organisation and he primarily attempted to attack the executive of this group for his grudge and the relationship with Abe, albeit he spoke he had no motive based on any political belief.\n\nAll politicians and LDP members mourned his death, and every party across the ruling and the opposition accused the attacker of the violence against democracy and showed solidarity. The Japanese people are shocked by the gun violence and the attack on politics and democracy. The media is comparing the incident to the past attempted assassination against Shin Kanemaru or the actual assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, and the SNS is afraid that the assassination would repeat the past police-state pre-war dark time like after the assassination of the May 15th incident and the February 26th incident occurred."

This legislation aims to control the commercial distribution, liberalise book pricing, and regulate unique governmental licenses on the book reselling, with several criminal penalties for its violation. The legislation consists of the amendment of other acts, such as the Antimonopoly Law, as well as the new \"Secondhand Books Resellers Control Act\".\n\nThe Oppositions and activists for the freedom of thought are loudly criticising this legislation. First, liberalising of pricing will not be able to buy books at an appropriately affordable price anymore as well as will lead to sell at higher prices in remote rural areas. Second, it cannot allow reselling the book without the license then the reader would just dump books into the garbage so that the book from past to present will not have remained for the future generation. Third, those difficulties will lead the publishing to be more agitating, more profitable, more biased, less educational, less reliable, and less diversified. Some activists are connecting the legislation to the recent harsh prosecution against political critics.

However, the Oppositions and activists criticise this amendment that this small amendment means that the government will never overlook against \"unconstitutional\" citations. They are pointing out that at this moment the unconstitutional thing is nothing but only meaning that it is illegal, so every creator will be dispirited on their creativities for the regulation of citation.

 mdmosjap_japan_kato.1.t:0 "The Quintet"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.1.d:0 "Yoshiro Mori has been elected as the Prime Minister in the Diet after being elected as the president of LDP in April, as \"the successor\" of former Prime Minister Obuchi. At the same time, some criticisms hit Mori for the process of how he was elected.\n\nTo begin with, Mori was not elected on the LDP's internal election but was appointed by five executives of the party in the end. After Obuchi went into the hospital, Mori and the other four \"colossi\" of the LDP had gathered at a hotel in Tokyo. After a while, Masakuni Murakami, an attendance, said \"Mr. Mori, there's no one but you\", then other attendees sided with that voice so Mori was appointed.\nSecond, the attendees at the hotel meeting have only consisted of the Mori faction, Obuchi faction, and Kamei faction and not included Kato faction, the rivalry group of Obuchi's. Koichi Kato, the leader of the Kato faction which belongs the Kochi-kai, is a rival of Keizo Obuchi since the 1998 LDP presidential election. Kato is the most proven one of leading the LDP to the strategic win on the 1996 Lower House Election against the Shinshin-to. However, Obuchi was disregarding Kato in the party for the difference of policies, while Kato is supported by the masses and the market. Because Obuchi was an advocate of fiscal spending, on the contrary Kato is a one of fiscal consolidation. And Kato is expected to be the next Prime Minister of Japan from the masses.\n\nConsidering these situations, the process done by the five members is evidently undemocratic one of the backroom politics like the old days in the Soviet Union."

In 1994, he and Hiromu Nonaka and Taku Yamasaki promoted the Ji-Sha-Sa (LDP-JSP-Sakigake) Coalition and were against the dual-conservative coalition plan between the LDP and the right faction of Shinshin-to. He was appointed to the Secretary-General of the LDP and led his party into winning on the 1996 Lower House Election of the two-party match against the Shinshin-to, then took back an absolute majority by his \"luring strategy\". His strategy led to the collapse of Shinshin-to, but the LDP lost in the 1998 Upper House Elections, then Kato resigns as the Secretary-General. He succeeded the chairperson of the Kochi-kai faction from Miyazawa and challenged for the 1999 LDP Presidential Election. Kato had a showdown with Yamasaki and Obuchi, despite he was supporting Obuchi because Kato felt the internal election like the Presidential Election was just a gateway to success, but Obuchi did not. Obuchi, the chairperson of the Heisei Kenkyukai (Heiseiken, former Keiseikai) faction, showed a fit of anger that his running was interrupted by Kato and Yamasaki. After Obuchi was elected, he tried to exclude Kato and Yamasaki from any status. While Kato and his Kochi-kai were getting an over-exclusion in the LDP, Kato's reformistic perspective for fiscal soundness and market liberalism gave him the national expectancy. And his Kochi-kai is one of the mainstream of LDP conservatism, despite Obuchi's oppression and Kato's liberal perspective. In addition, he has a strong anti-Keiseikai (anti-Heiseiken) \"YKK\" friendship, with Taku Yamasaki and Junichiro Koizumi. After the breaking down and death of Obuchi, and Mori's indistinct election and his gaffe, Kato is feeling the LDP will lose to the upcoming 2001 Upper House Elections."

Those surely share that liberalism is the precious thought that the people have gotten in the end, but the standards to measure \"liberalism\" are completely different among them, like there are the left radicalism, the centre-left, and the left-wing. Even if any compromises solidified them, they are naturally broken away - perhaps that is the literal nature of liberalism. And of course, there are two liberals on the political stage right now: the liberal members of LDP which includes the Left Kochi-kai, and the left members of the Democratic Party of Japan. To overcome the crisis, [Root.GetLeader] must talk with one of them to nullify the vote of non-confidence. But it probably means that one of both potentially favourable groups will be forced to cut the relationship from today."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.955.oA:0 "Suggest the political alliance with DPJ."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.955.oB:0 "Solidify with the Right of Kochi-kai."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.956.t:0 "Compromise with the Conservative"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.956.d:0 "It is simple to show the intent of compromisation to the conservatives: just stand up from the chair until the national anthem ends, then make a bow to the flag on the stage. [Root.GetLeader] followed and acted this while the conservative members of the LDP attended the meeting. Now he is just to talk about his cosmetic patriotism which was remembered before the meeting. But about a half of members are never filled with the superficial passion for patriotism because they believe that not waving the flag but realising the stout economic growth is the key to gain the popularity which can be exchanged for patriotism. Whereas the fanatic rightwingers would feel they were neglected in their ideology if [Root.GetLeader] took to speak about the economic growth."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.956.oA:0 "Insist on the economic growth."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.956.oB:0 "Talk about some issues in \"Nippon\"."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.957.t:0 "'Abekawa Offensive'"	#Abekawa Kousei
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.957.d:0 "These days, every private TV station is repeating political agitations against [Root.GetLeader] by the Nakagawa faction as an interlude between the murder case and the celebrities' quarrel. The recent U.S.F.J. helicopter crash at Okinawa International University makes people turn their eyes to the political crisis.\nOf course, the LDP executives are not just sitting in their chairs but appearing on the TV news program to counterargue against the Nakagawa faction's agitation and to make the counter-agitation. The Sunday debate program held some mild arguments among each representative of the executives, the Nakagawa faction, and the oppositions. People are surely recognising that the crisis is happening, then the conflict is spreading to the LDP branches nationwide and interest groups."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.957.oA:0 "Solidify with the Prefectural Branches."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.957.oB:0 "Talk about some \"beneficial\" thing..."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.958.t:0 "Meeting with heads of the Prefectural Branches"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.958.d:0 "The prefectural branches are not the physical form to make sure the top-down system but a democratic system to communicate demands and offers between the headquarters and the rural. Even if the HQ wants to direct rule but it would be rejected when the HQ did not show the stance to compromise for what the branch wants. But if it is before the important elections or someone who was the leader has a charismatic ability or huge popularity across the nation, the HQ could put their demand unilaterally. Though no one would judge right now that the current Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] has some abilities like that..."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.958.oA:0 "Give the way to the branches."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.958.oB:0 "Press our policies to them!"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.959.t:0 "The Backroom Politics"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.959.d:0 "As someone once referred before, the backroom politics is the essence of the LDP, and of Japanese politics. There is not only talking about the personnel affairs on cabinet formation but also exchanging some shady things to make profits for the people or only for them. Not only the Prime Minister but also every dietmember has their own interest group which could support them. And some members form the dietmembers' group for their interests and supporters without taking care of the party's policy or the national thoughts - that is known as \"Zoku-giin\". At a hotel somewhere in the [Root.Capital.GetName], [Root.GetLeader] and the other LDP members across the factional interests are holding the meeting to negotiate about the profit or maybe the post in the party or the cabinet, in exchange for each one vote against the non-confidence. In the end, [Root.GetLeader] and the executives of the party proposed..."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.959.oA:0 "To make supports for the party's interest group."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.959.oB:0 "To give some posts for Zoku-giins."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.960.t:0 "'National Disaster'"	#Kokunan
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.960.d:0 "The LDP crisis is now the national common topic because the anchor of the new 10 PM news program is repeatedly reporting that like a live broadcast of some pro-wrestling matches. In addition, the earthquake in Niigata turned the people's eyes of curiosity toward the political news collaterally reported. Not only this program but also the morning wide-show program broadcasting the Nakagawa faction's agitation so the children watch it before they go to school then mimic that in the classroom to gather the other children's popularity. The parents are also arguing the LDP crisis with other parents in the housing complex, or in the smoking-room, or in the park, or in the supermarket. People have completely waived to follow the rule to be a regular Japanese then forgot to avoid talking about political things. On the Internet, a bulletin-board-system website is gathering popularity for discussing the LDP crisis, although most of the threads at there is filled with tons of zero head barbaric arguments, ideologic prejudices, and racist rants related with Asians.\n\nIn any case, the mostly subconsciously conservative people, Japanese people are judging that the Nakagawa faction \"has good skill at the agitation\", which eventually turns into a substantial attack against [Root.GetLeader].\nPerhaps many of LDP dietmembers will change their stance along with the people's point of view. Perhaps some oppositions will take advantage of the people's voice.\n\nIn the end, the LDP crisis is no longer the crisis that can be ended within the LDP itself."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.960.oA:0 "The factioncy talks everything in the end."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.960.oB:0 "A charismatic man will defend the party from the self destruction."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.961.t:0 "The Last Move"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.961.d:0 "Many people hate factionalism even though it is already the natural thing before the monkey became mankind. And the modern Japanese people also hate factionalism, because many troubles and wars were caused by factionalism. But a lot of post-war political conflicts were dissolved by factionalism too. Some of the executives are proposing that giving some cabinet posts to the Nakagawa faction will cease the counter-revolt without fail, but the others are claiming that it is not the reconciliation but the capitulation so do not give any posts to them.\n\nIn any case, this would be the last defence before the Nakagawa faction moves the vote of non-confidence against [Root.GetLeader]."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.961.oA:0 "Reserve a good post for Nakagawa Faction."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.961.oB:0 "Who wants to give some seats for these freaking traitors?"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.962.t:0 "The Last Move"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.962.d:0 "Most historic decisions across the world were made by charismatic persons. And in every difficult time, the people are demanding the arrival of another new charismatic person - even though they have good or bad intentions. The executives have already understood the situation and they are planning whom they support to be elected as the next party president of the LDP. Yasuo Fukuda, the son of the former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, is not a member of Kochi-kai but performs as the coordinator among LDP factions, so the executives are thinking that he is rather better than losing this conflict. A few executives are proposing Shinzo Abe, the counterpart of Shoichi Nakagawa and the sub captain of the Nakagawa faction, although the other executives are refusing this because it means nothing but just the surrender to the Nakagawa faction.\n\nIn any case, this would be the last defence before the Nakagawa faction moves the vote of non-confidence against [Root.GetLeader]."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.962.oA:0 "Yasuo Fukuda."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.962.oB:0 "Shinzo Abe."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.971.t:0 "Defeat of Kochi-kai"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.971.d:0 "Various negotiations and colourful threats. [Root.GetLeader] has attempted to cease the counter-resurrection by the Nakagawa faction, like the then LDP executives against Koichi Kato in 2000. But history has repeated itself again. Today, the Lower House passed the vote of non-confidence against [Root.GetLeader] by the LDP conservatives as well as the oppositions. Nobody knows whether the oppositions guessed the LDP liberals have no ability for governance or calculated that the situation could help them. Anyway, there is one firm result that the LDP liberals' ambition is now crashed four years later from the Kato's Revolt."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.971.oA:0 "Now, [Root.GetLeader] decided to quit his job..."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.971.oB:0 "...and dissolved the Lower House."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.972.t:0 "The 'For Whom' Dissolution"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.972.d:0 "Days later since the Nakagawa faction's counter-revolt has succeeded, Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] announced the dissolution of the Lower House with the temporal resignation of their cabinet. The nominal reason for the dissolution and the incoming election is for the national re-recognition of their new regime, but some people are considering that there is basically no benefit for the people and it was just a drama that was performed only at the court."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.976.t:0 "Victory of Kochi-kai"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.976.d:0 "At the end of the political maneuvers and conspiracies, Kochi-kai and Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] has prevailed over the eighty-four days of conflict by the refusal of the vote of non-confidence."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.976.oA:0 "Now we can take a rest."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.977.t:0 "The tranquilisation of Nakagawa Faction"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.977.d:0 "Midst of the counter-resurrection by the Nakagawa faction, tens of members have tried to prevail them to calm down by not only flashing threats but also proposing beneficial conditions. Fortunately, the Nakagawa faction has taken some conditions and finally showed the obedience toward the party and [Root.GetLeader]. They took solidarity instead of extreme factionalism."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.977.oA:0 "No one can destroy the LDP!"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.981.t:0 "Nakagawa Faction Broke Away From the LDP"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.981.d:0 "Midst of the counter-resurrection by the Nakagawa faction, tens of members have tried to prevail them to calm down by not only flashing threats but also proposing beneficial conditions. But in the end, the Nakagawa faction denied swallowing any proposals. Today, faction leader Shoichi Nakagawa and his followers submitted the letters of secession from LDP."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.981.oA:0 "We've seen the same thing every time. Who cares."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.982.t:0 "The Split of Centre-Right"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.982.d:0 "Five days later from the Nakagawa faction's break-up from the party, other centre-right factions announced that they are leaving the LDP. In addition, they are announcing the foundation of new party, \"Japan Cooperative Party\". There is no clue that their leaving is related to Nakagawa's move."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.982.oA:0 "Wait, what?!"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.983.t:0 "The Separation of Komei-to"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.983.d:0 "Following the tripartisan dividing of the LDP, their fellow party Komei-to has also divided in the end, after arguing about whom they must follow - the LDP led by [Root.GetLeader], or the Nakagawa faction, or other remains of LDP, or other oppositions. Most of the members of Komei-to are still showing a firm empathy with the Soka Gakkai, their power base as well as their destination of faith, but there is no contradiction that their influence on the politics will be drastically reduced by this situation - needless to say, some are willing to this for the realising of the separation of church and state."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.983.oA:0 "They could be but we should not!"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.984.t:0 "The Last Day of the Big Tent"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.984.d:0 "No one expected this will happen, even the anti-LDP activists. No one expected the same thing will happen as the JSP collapsed. Contrary to the left-winger's JSP, the literal big-tent party for the \"liberal\" and \"democratic\" thought had been seen that they will maintain and fortify their party to the achievement, whether it was the amendment of the constitution or the re-realising of the high economic growth. Whereas the fate of the party was changed after various political conflicts, and the last stab of the Nisshi-ren scandal tore the solidarity and then finished off the party. Now every people are arguing with their hindsight - the LDP would not have been decayed if Koichi Kato has not been elected, any other charismatic politician who has the heart of a lion would have fortified the party, and so on. However, there is no childish fantasy but a relentless truth - the Liberal Democratic Party has collapsed. The ultra-conservatives announced they found their own new party, \"Japan Progressive Party\", as the centre-right and some left have gone to their new home, \"Japan Cooperative Party\". LDP and JSP, both parties once had a prosperous time, is gone, and history. On the final day of the year 2004, the 1955 system collapsed in the end."

 mdmosjap_japan_kato.985.d:0 "The [Root.GetLeader] administration was already doomed to be dissolved, especially after the LDP had collapsed for his mismanagement of the party. Following the meeting with the opposition including the remains of the former LDP, the 2005 Diet ordinary session was scheduled to be finished under their government in exchange for dissolving the Lower House. All legislations and budget bills have been passed, and [Root.GetLeader] announced the dissolution of the Lower House."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.986.t:0 "\"Ask for the people\" Dissolution"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.986.d:0 "Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] announced the dissolution of the Lower House and the resignation of their cabinet. This year there were the Upper House Elections but it did not become an Upper-Lower simultaneous election in the end. There was some hearsay of unhealthiness on the Prime Minister, but they did not answer this question. Most people think that they are living in a strangely different timeline because of the unimaginable collapse of the LDP that the people think it should not do, so everyone is not thinking about the election seriously."
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.987.t:0 "\"Ask for the people\" Dissolution"
 mdmosjap_japan_kato.987.d:0 "Prime Minister [Root.GetLeader] announced the dissolution of the Lower House, to be judged by the people on how their new government does well. Some said the Prime Minister once demanded to hold the Lower House Elections with the Upper House Elections but it was finally avoided in the case of the risk of the government paralysing when [Root.GetRulingParty] failed in the election. Most people think that they are living in a strangely different timeline because of the unimaginable collapse of the LDP that the people think it should not do, so everyone is not thinking about the election seriously."

The prominent big-tent conservatives' Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been dissolved and split into three parts: the left-conservatives succeeding LDP, the centre-right Nippon Kyōdō-tō (CPJ), and the ultraconservative Nippon Shimpo-tō (JPP).\nThe former LDP was founded in 1955, due to the amalgamation of the 1954-founded Democratic Party and the 1950-founded Liberal Party, to fight against the former Japan Socialist Party which had also amalgamated around the same time. Contrary to the collapsed JSP at the end of the 20th century, the LDP remained to be a famous \"1955 system\", while they were used be said to will be collapsed in 1965 or 1985."

 mdmosjap_japancv.200101.t:0 "Antivaccine Infodemics and Temptation"
 mdmosjap_japancv.200101.d:0 "After about a year from the first confirmation of Covid-19, every pharmaceutical company is working to produce the vaccine rapidly. While every people hope for its arrival, some groups of anti-vaccine believers are efforting for spreading the information of their theories. In Japan, some activists form a political party to propagating \"the novel coronavirus is just a cold\" intently and openly, and without wearing a mask. Needless to say, almost all of the medical professionals reject that opinion as not correct and accuses it of life-threatening misinformation. Also, the people are looking coldly on the anti-vaccine believer. This is just one of the far radical cases of anti-vaccine movement, but there are other cases of spreading misinformation about the vaccination. The cause of the infodemic is, one is the \"far-centric neutrality\" which is misapplied from the broadcasting neutrality, and the other is the SNS culture of \"First buzzed, first served\". Many professionals of medicals, politics, sociology, and anti-cult activists who once fight against Aum Shinrikyo, are trying to get rid of every misinformation as fast as possible, but any fact-checks are not catching up with the next production of misinformation. Those professionals, fact-checkers, and people are demanding the government to take part in the counter-spread resistance of the anti-vaccine misinformation, such as the full utilisation of the public service announcement or order every TV station and SNS company to prevent spreading. However, several dietmembers and cabinet members are not welcoming it for some reasons like they are already an anti-vaccine believer, or not an anti-vaccine believer but the risk for the freedom of speech by the participation, or feeling of rejection toward the cost and indemnification."
